# weather-app


<h3><b>Summary</b></h3>

<p>In this project, i have created a weather app in which i have used the latest web technologies and tried my best to create the website interface as simple as possible and a user friendly interface and working of the website. I have worked with html to give the structure of the website and enhanced it using cascading style sheets to give it proper and minimalistic look which makes the website attractive and easy to use. I have used javascript for the working of the website and additionaly i have made the website real-time which means that users can check the current weather in the app. For that, i have used weather api using javascript to made this possible.</p>
